    "The massive volcanic eruption near Tonga in the Pacific Ocean (20.550°S 175.385°W) occurred at 04:14:45 [UTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) on 15 January 2022. The above animation (credit: Tim Schmit, NOAA/NESDIS/ASPB) shows propogation of the shockwave across the Earth as seen from space (using infrared measurements of water vapor). That shockwave was also measured as changing pressure in weather stations around the world. \n",

    "a) The CSV file `data/california_pressure_2022_01_15.csv` contains [Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS)](https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/ASOS/) pressure measurements at 64 stations in California taken several hours later that day, observed with 1-minute resolution. Read this data into a `pandas` DataFrame and then plot in the same figure the pressure as a function of time at SBA (Santa Barbara Municipal Airport, in Southern California), OAK (Oakland Airport, Bay Area), and MHS (Mount Shasta City, in Northern California). To allow a better visual comparison between the three, divide each plot by the initial value at the start of each of the timeseries. Overplot a 5-min thick vertical line for each timeseries (with the same color as the line) at the maximum of that series."
